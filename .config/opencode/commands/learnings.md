description: Summarize your learnings from this conversation into AGENTS.md
subtask: true
---

Create or update AGENTS.md with learnings from this conversation that will help future development sessions. Focus exclusively on: (1) project-specific conventions (naming, file organization, patterns), (2) step-by-step procedures for recurring tasks (deployment, testing, adding features), and (3) gotchas or non-obvious requirements. Exclude one-time fixes, resolved bugs, or context that won't recur. Prioritize brevity—this file must stay small to remain effective as a reference.
