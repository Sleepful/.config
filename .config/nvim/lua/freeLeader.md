This are up for grabs:

- t (could be for teles bc `s` is too loaded)
- m (could be for jumping to marks, as I overwrote \` key, but `m` still leaves marks)

additionally:

<f2> in insert mode is free, right now it opens some stuff that could be moved to tele
<F2> in normal mode is,,, ok?

nav: 

- <Home> <End>for bookmarks
- <S-PageUp><S-PageDown> for quiqkfix
- need one for diagnostics? could be <S-Home> <S-End>

telescope:

- <c-s> hop to result
- <c-q> send to quickfix list
