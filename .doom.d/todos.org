* Evil visual mode
when I leave a visual selection, the cursor jumps back to the start of the visual selection. Is there a way to let the cursor stay at the ending position of the selection after removing the selection?
* Enter/leave emacsclient - projectile
when opening from terminal with `ec`, emacsclient opens in a new workspace
when leaving this emacsclient `qq`, the workspace and its buffer dies
how to leave without killing workspacebuffer? maybe `enc` first and then `ec`? we don't want this all the time
- something like "quit but leave open" would be nice, perhaps new hotkey `qk` "quit keep". Maybe this is just `ecn arg && ec $_`
- however, 'ecn' can't be used without file arg. How to open ec without new workspace?
- something like "ec" but without "new workspace" would be very nice
* add "counsel dotfiles"
